/**
 * M3: Spindle Clockwise
 * M4: Spindle Counter-clockwise
 *
 *  S0 turns off spindle.
 *
 *  If no speed PWM output is defined then M3/M4 just turns it on.
 *
 *  At least 12.8KHz (50Hz * 256) is needed for spindle PWM.
 *  Hardware PWM is required. ISRs are too slow.
 *
 * NOTE: WGM for timers 3, 4, and 5 must be either Mode 1 or Mode 5.
 *       No other settings give a PWM signal that goes from 0 to 5 volts.
 *
 *       The system automatically sets WGM to Mode 1, so no special
 *       initialization is needed.
 *
 *       WGM bits for timer 2 are automatically set by the system to
 *       Mode 1. This produces an acceptable 0 to 5 volt signal.
 *       No special initialization is needed.
 *
 * NOTE: A minimum PWM frequency of 50 Hz is needed. All prescaler
 *       factors for timers 2, 3, 4, and 5 are acceptable.
 *
 *  SPINDLE_LASER_ENABLE_PIN needs an external pullup or it may power on
 *  the spindle/laser during power-up or when connecting to the host
 *  (usually goes through a reset which sets all I/O pins to tri-state)
 *
 *  PWM duty cycle goes from 0 (off) to 255 (always on).

   * Our final value for ocr_val is an unsigned 8 bit value between 0 and 255 which usually means uint8_t.
   * Went to uint16_t because some of the uint8_t calculations would sometimes give 1000 0000 rather than 1111 1111.
   * Then needed to AND the uint16_t result with 0x00FF to make sure we only wrote the byte of interest.
